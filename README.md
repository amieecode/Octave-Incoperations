## :star2: Project 2: Provide Insights to the executive team in the telecom domain (Level - Begineer)
> Problem Statement
### CLIEF is a major telecom provider in Nigeria, and it, along with other telecom providers, unveiled 5G plans in May 2022. However, following the launch of 5G in May 2022, management observed a decrease in active users and revenue growth. CLIEF's business director asked that their analytics team provide a comparison report of key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after the 5G launch. The management is eager to compare the performance of these times in order to gain insights that will allow them to make informed decisions in order to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They are also curious as to whether they can optimize their internet plans in order to attract more active customers.

### Tasks:
### Imagine yourself as a junior data analyst and perform the following task:
1. Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Please note the mock-up is created by a business user who has a minimal idea about  dashboarding. Hence, you need to represent the insights in a much better way.
2. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.
### Other resources provided:
- Metrics List (this contains most of the metrics you need for the dashboard and you might need to create more metrics based on the additional visuals you add to the dashboard).
- Metadata.
