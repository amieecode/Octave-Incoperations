### Imagine yourself as a junior data analyst and perform the following task:

2. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.
### Other resources provided:
- Metrics List (this contains most of the metrics you need for the dashboard and you might need to create more metrics based on the additional visuals you add to the dashboard).
